## Introduction
Database keys are used in Relational Database Models to establish/identify relationships between 
tables and uniquely identify rows within the tables. We cover three types of
keys:

- `PRIMARY KEY`
- `FOREIGN KEY`
- `UNIQUE KEY`

We also illustrate their functionality with relevant code examples.
